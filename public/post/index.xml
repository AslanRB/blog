      <description>Usually most of the information is in the text, and plots are used to highlight the key information. Not in this. Here, I tried to put ALL the informaton in the plots. For the most part, you could just go from plot to plot, looking at each one until you understand what is going on, and you got all the information – and I encourage you to do so. If it doesn’t work, the information is also in the text.</description>
