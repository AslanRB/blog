      <description>Usually most of the information is in the text, and plots are used to highlight the key information. Not in this. Here, I tried to put ALL the informaton in the plots. For the most part, you could just go from plot to plot, looking at each one until you understand what is going on, and you got all the information – and I encourage you to do so. If it doesn’t work, the information is also in the text.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.</description>
